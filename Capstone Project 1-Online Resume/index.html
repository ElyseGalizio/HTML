    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>As a dedicated person with an empathetic nature, I thrive in situations where I can use my creative problem-solving and a listening ear. Entering the tech field later in life, I am well-placed to build on my experience in client-facing roles where I excel thanks to my gentle communication and my inherent desire to help people. This always allows me to meet the needs of others with humor, kindness, pragmatism, and confidence.</p>
